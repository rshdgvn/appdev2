### Section: BSIS-3B

## 1. What went well

- I gained a deeper understanding of how **React works internally**, not just how to code in React. I now understand how components function, how they are reused through importing and exporting, and how different **React hooks** work and interact within an application.
- My knowledge of **Git** improved significantly. Beyond basic usage, I now understand how commands like `git reset`, `git rebase`, and `git revert` work, especially when fixing mistakes and managing commit history.
- I also learned how to **call APIs** properly using tools like `fetch` and **Axios**, including how requests work, how responses are handled, and the concept of **API origins** and how they affect data communication between the frontend and backend.


---

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges

- My main challenge was **time management**. As a developer, I was not consistent with my coding schedule, which caused our project to fall behind our planned timeline.
- Because of this inconsistency, we were unable to properly **code freeze** before the final defense. As a result, unresolved changes led to a bug appearing during our final presentation.
- This experience helped me realize the importance of discipline, consistent development, and final testing before deployment or defense.

## 3. Key Learnings
- I strengthened my understanding of the **basics of JavaScript**, which helped me write cleaner logic and better understand how applications work.
- I learned how **React works internally**, including its **component-based architecture**, reusability of components, and how data flows within an application.
- I gained a clearer understanding of how React components interact using **props and hooks**, which helped me build more structured and maintainable code.
- I learned that being a developer is **not only about coding**, but also about proper **planning and time management** before implementation.
- Overall, I realized that combining **good planning** with **strong technical fundamentals** leads to better project outcomes and fewer last-minute issues.

## 4. Areas for Improvement

- I aim to improve my **time management and consistency in coding** by setting clear schedules and following development milestones.
- I want to strengthen my skills in **project planning**, including task breakdown, prioritization, and proper code freezing before final submissions.
- I plan to deepen my understanding of **JavaScript and React**, especially performance optimization and best practices.
- I also aim to enhance my **communication and collaboration** within a team to keep projects aligned and on track.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)

- I expect to learn the **foundations of React Native and TypeScript**, which will give me a solid understanding of mobile application development.  
- I hope the discussions are **practical, hands-on, and engaging**, as this approach helps me truly understand concepts and apply them effectively, rather than just memorizing information.
